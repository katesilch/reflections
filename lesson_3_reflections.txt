When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	Having a remote repository is useful when you work on the project using different
	computers. For example, you can do the changes to the project on your computer
	at work, and then come home and use the remote repository to see or pull these
	changes to your home computer/laptop. Also, when there are several people involved
	in the project, most likely that they will not share the same computer, which
	means that they will have to somehow access the project's repository to make the
	changes or see the changes made by others. Remote repository would be the best
	tool to make it happen.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If Git will automatically pull changes from the remote repository, then they
	both will be identical to remote repository. But what will happen if there
	were commits in Git that the programmer wanted to push to remote repository
	to update it? Instead, the most current version of the branch will be replaced
	with the outdated one.
