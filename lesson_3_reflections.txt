When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  Having a remote repository is useful when you work on the project using different
  computers. For example, you can do the changes to the project on your computer
  at work, and then come home and use the remote repository to see or pull these
  changes to your home computer/laptop. Also, when there are several people involved
  in the project, most likely that they will not share the same computer, which
  means that they will have to somehow access the project's repository to make the
  changes or see the changes made by others. Remote repository would be the best
  tool to make it happen.
